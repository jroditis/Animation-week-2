# Animation-week-2

For this e-commerce test project, I wanted to use this opportunity to tie this into a project for another class. I am developing a book-centered social platform called Bookmarkd - think Goodreads, if it was actually good. A major feature of this platform would be connecting to your local library system's catalogue, and possibly allowing you to check books out from the platform. While I go back and forth on this last idea, since it would most likely end up being Doordash For Librarians TM, and I wouldn't wish that on anyone, it was still an idea worth trying out. 
I wanted to try three animations out: 1. A simple button-press-to-cart-update interaction typical in e-commerce, 2. A dynamic page swipe, and 3. A carousel transition with stylized delayed loading animations. 
1. The Button: I wanted to try to use Figma exclusively and as much as possible. I got as far as making the button change color. I don't understand variables and conditionals. My brain gets scrambled easily.
2. The Page Swipe: the GIF file attached to this project doesn't do this justice, unfortunately. The little details in the interaction can't be picked up by the frame rate. I'm really happy with it, but I can't prove that it looks good in this instance - something something, if a tree falls in the woods and no one's there to hear it, you get the idea.
3. The Carousel Transition: this was the point where I gave up and cracked open After Effects. I think I got a little too ambitious with the amount of moving parts, but I'm still pretty happy with the result so far, and think I could refine it into something better.
